        I love baking because being known as the bringer-of-cake is pretty
        great. I truly and deeply believe in the magic of homemade birthday
        cake, and I basically want everyone to give it a shot at least once.
      </p>
      <p class="p-cake">
        Enter this two-bowl cake designed to be easy to put together, like a
        boxed cake, and perfect for any party!

      <h2>How to Make Vanilla Cake</h2>
      <p class="p-cake">
        The cake has a soft crumb and goes heavy on the vanilla to hit some
        nostalgia buttons. There’s a little butter that gets worked into the dry
        mixture, which keeps the cake tender and adds a little flavor. I also
        use oil because it keeps the cake from drying out. The perfect frosting
        for this cake is a basic vanilla buttercream (sometimes called American
        Buttercream), which is a simple mixture of butter, powdered sugar,
        cream, and flavoring whipped together until fluffy and spreadable. This
        cake would be great with pretty much any frosting you love.
      </p>

      <h2>Cake vs. All-Purpose Flour?</h2>
      <p class="p-cake">
        I tested this cake with both cake flour and all-purpose flour. Both work
        great! You can do a direct substitution (by weight) with no problems.
        The cake flour makes for a slightly more tender cake, and in my opinion,
        gives you a little more wiggle room in the way of overmixing since it
        has less protein (overmixing + protein = gluten + chew).
      </p>

      <h2>What Size Cake Pan to Use?</h2>
      <p class="p-cake">
        This cake is baked in a 9x13-inch rectangular cake pan, which is a great
        size for potlucks and parties. It can also be baked as two 9-inch rounds
        for a layered cake. The round layers can potentially bake more quickly.
        So be sure to check them after about 22 minutes in the oven.
      </p>
      <h2>Store and Freeze This Cake</h2>
      <p class="p-cake">
        I usually make this cake the night before, just because I like to split
        up my baking and frosting days (a lot of cake moves through my
        kitchen!). But this cake is fine baked the same day or in advance.
      </p>
      <p class="p-cake">
        <b>If you’re making the cake a day ahead,</b> just cool and wrap it well
        with plastic and leave it at room temperature until you are ready to
        frost it.
      </p>
      <p class="p-cake">
        <b>If you want to bake the cake even farther in advance,</b>> bake and
        cool it as directed. Then, turn the cooled cake out and wrap it well in
        a double layer of plastic wrap, and freeze for up to two weeks.
      </p>
      <p class="p-cake">
        Since buttercream frosting is pretty easy to make, I always wait to
        frost the cake the day I serve it. However, if you want, you can make
        the frosting in advance and store it in an airtight container in either
        the refrigerator (for several days) or the freezer (for several weeks).
      </p>
      <p class="p-cake">
        Defrost the frosting on the counter at room temperature and beat
        vigorously with a mixer to fluff it up again.
